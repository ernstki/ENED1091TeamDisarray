13ss-ened1091-group-project
===========================

A repository for Team Dis[array]'s 13SS\_ENED091 group project: an animated demonstration of various sort algorithms implemented using a MATLAB GUI.

Planned Features
----------------
* Visualization of each iteration of at least 3 different CS I-ish sort algorithms (planned bubble, selection, quick) using bar plots and array contents (for small values of n).
  * Drill-down menus for under-the-hood tweaks for several algorithms (_e.g._, quick sort with different methods for choosing a pivot; 3-way merge sort)
* Timed head-to-head race of up to three algorithms, with results in a bar plot format.


Feature Wish List
-----------------
* Compare built-in MATLAB sort routine to the ones implemented as .m scripts
* Compare our sort algorithms to one implemented in C (MEX interface)
* Benchmarking - record system information and allow upload/comparison of results from different machines/architectures for a standard suite of sort performance tests.
