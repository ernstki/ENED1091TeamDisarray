===========================

A repository for Team Dis[array]'s 13SS\_ENED091 group project: an animated demonstration of various sort algorithms implemented using a MATLAB GUI.

Feature Wish List
-----------------
* Compare built-in MATLAB sort routine to the ones implemented as .m scripts
* Compare our sort algorithms to one implemented in C (MEX interface)
* Benchmarking - record system information and allow upload/comparison of results from different machines/architectures for a standard suite of sort performance tests.
